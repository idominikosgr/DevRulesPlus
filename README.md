# DevRulesPlus

An enhanced framework for AI-assisted development that provides comprehensive rules, patterns, and guidelines for AI coding assistants across multiple platforms, languages, and technologies.

## Overview

DevRulesPlus enhances AI-assisted development by providing comprehensive guidelines for AI coding assistants across multiple platforms. The project features specialized rules for various languages, frameworks, and technologies, with a focus on modern development practices, memory management, and cross-session continuity.

Key features include:
- Multi-platform support for different AI assistants and IDEs
- Enhanced language and technology-specific rule files
- Memory management and session handoff protocols
- Interactive setup wizard for project-specific configuration
- Version-controlled rule files with compatibility indicators

## Structure

The rules are organized in `.ai/rules/` with a comprehensive and extensible structure:

- **Core rules**: Foundation files that define AI behavior and project context (`00-*`, `01-*`, `02-*`, etc.)
- **Tasks (`tasks/`)**: 51 task-specific rules for specialized AI behaviors (e.g., `AI-Session-Handoff.mdc`, `Code-Quality-Review.mdc`)
- **Assistants (`assistants/`)**: Rules specific to various AI assistants (e.g., `Windsurf.mdc`)

  - **Tauri.mdc**: Modern Electron alternative usage patterns
  - **SwiftData.mdc**: Apple's data persistence framework guidelines
- **AI Tools (`ai-tools/`)**: Guides for AI-enhanced development
  - **Agentic-AI-Development.mdc**: Guidelines for different AI assistants
  - **MCP-Server-Integration.mdc**: Patterns for memory server integration
  - **Sequential-Thinking-Advanced.mdc**: Complex problem decomposition
  - **AI-Workflow-Integration.mdc**: Task-specific AI-assisted patterns
- **Tool Guides (`tools/`)**: Guidelines for common development tools
  - **File-Operations.mdc**: Best practices for file manipulation
  - **Code-Search.mdc**: Effective code search patterns
  - **Command-Execution.mdc**: Safe terminal command execution

## Installation

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idominikosgr/DevRulesPlus.git
cd DevRulesPlus
```

2. Run the setup wizard:

```bash
node setup-wizard.js
```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to configure AIDevRules for your project:
   - Enter your project path
   - Select your IDE or AI coding tool (Cursor AI, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, VS Code, etc.)
   - Choose your primary framework
   - Select your programming language
   - Pick your technology stack
   - Select additional technologies
   - Choose AI tools to configure

The wizard will automatically create the appropriate directory structure and copy the relevant rule files to your project.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idominikosgr/DevRulesPlus.git .cursor
```

2. Customize the project-specific files:

- Edit `.cursor/rules/01-project-context.mdc` with your project details
- Modify `.cursor/rules/02-common-errors.mdc` with project-specific anti-patterns
- Update `.cursor/rules/03-mcp-configuration.mdc` with your MCP server configuration

## Usage

### For Cursor AI Users

AIDevRules will be automatically loaded when you use Cursor AI in a project containing these rules.

### For GitHub Copilot Users

While Copilot doesn't directly support loading external rules, you can still benefit by:

1. Keeping the rules visible in your workspace
2. Referencing specific rule files in your prompts

### For ChatGPT/Claude Users

Upload relevant rule files to provide context when working on specific tasks.

### Activating a Task Rule

You can explicitly request a specific task rule:

```
Please refactor this code using @tasks/Refactor-Code.mdc
```

Or the AI might activate a task rule semantically based on your request.

### Providing Project Context

For new projects, you should update the project context file:

```
Please update the project context with our React/Node.js stack and component structure.
```

### Documenting Common Errors

Add project-specific patterns to avoid:

```
Please add a common error pattern about our naming convention for API routes.
```

### Configuring MCP Awareness

To ensure the AI knows which MCP servers are available and how they are configured:

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+, or Ctrl+,)
2. Go to the 'MCP' section
3. Open your global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file via the provided button/link
4. Make sure `mcp.json` is the active file in your editor
5. In the AI chat, ask: "Please populate `.cursor/rules/03-mcp-configuration.mdc` based on the attached `mcp.json` context."
6. The AI should read the attached `mcp.json` context and fill in the details about each server in `03-mcp-configuration.mdc`.

## Benefits

- More accurate code assistance based on your project context
- Stack-specific guidance for different technology combinations
- Consistent response format and quality
- Reduced need to repeat instructions
- Improved code quality and adherence to best practices

## Customization

The rule files use a consistent Markdown format that's easy to customize for your specific needs. See the `Cursor-Rules.md` file at the project root for detailed formatting guidelines and best practices.

## Updating

To update the standard `tasks/`, `languages/`, `technologies/` rules and the core `00-core-agent.mdc`, while preserving your customized `01-project-context.mdc` and `02-common-errors.mdc`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idominikosgr/DevRulesPlus/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --upgrade
```
*Note: The upgrade process preserves `03-mcp-configuration.mdc`. If new standard MCP servers are added to DevRules in the future, you may need to manually update your `03-mcp-configuration.mdc` or ask the AI to regenerate it.*
